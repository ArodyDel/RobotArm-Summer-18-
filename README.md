# RobotArm-Summer-18-
We created a Tic Tac Toe game where you can interact with a Robotic arm. The robot arm has six degrees of freedom and is used to place blocks onto the game board. The game has three different modes you can choose from, which are Human vs. Human, Human vs. AI(easy Mode), and Human vs. AI(Challenge Mode). Our user interface communicates with the arm and makes moves for both players.
